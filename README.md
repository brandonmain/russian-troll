### What is a russian-troll?
A russian troll is a bot that will post to Twitter via a command from the command and control server.
### How does it work?
This program works like many other botnets by infecting a host machine to become a zombie that is controlled by the command and control server. The infected host will then become a russian-troll by leveraging the Twitter API to create a twitter account from the host machine and using this new account to post to Twitter.
